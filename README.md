# Intelligent-Analysis-of-Pharmaceutical-Product-Descriptions-Using-NLP-and-Deep-Learning
Built and evaluated classical and transformer-based NLP models to classify therapeutic classes from medicine descriptions. Applied text preprocessing, feature engineering, and deep learning to benchmark performance and generate structured summaries from pharmaceutical text data.
Overview

This project focuses on analysing large-scale pharmaceutical text data using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The MID dataset contains detailed descriptions of over 192,000 medicinal products across 44 therapeutic classes. The goal is to transform unstructured medicine descriptions into structured, actionable insights.

Objectives

Classify medicines into therapeutic classes based on textual descriptions

Generate structured summaries from unstructured pharmaceutical text

Compare traditional machine learning and deep learning NLP approaches

Evaluate model performance and scalability across multiple tasks

Methods

Text preprocessing and feature engineering (tokenisation, TF-IDF, embeddings)

Traditional models: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM

Deep learning models: LSTM, CNN, Transformer-based architectures
